Minitalk is a project in the 42 curriculum that involves developing a client-server application in the C language. The goal of the project is to create a communication program that allows two processes to communicate with each other using only signals.

The project consists of two main programs: the client and the server. The client is responsible for sending messages to the server, while the server is responsible for receiving messages from the client and displaying them.

The messages are sent using signals, which are a form of inter-process communication in Unix-based systems. The client sends a message to the server by sending a sequence of 0 and 1 signals, where 0 represents a bit value of 0 and 1 represents a bit value of 1. The server receives the signals and converts them back into a message.

To implement this communication system, the project requires knowledge of signal handling, binary operations, and basic network programming concepts. The project also involves handling errors and edge cases, such as when a message is too large to be sent in a single signal transmission.

Overall, the Minitalk project is a challenging and rewarding exercise in C programming that allows students to develop their skills in systems programming, network programming, and signal handling.
